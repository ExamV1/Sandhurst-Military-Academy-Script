Delete Invisible barriers: this simple removes any invisible barriers that prevent you from crossing a certain area. 


Invisibility tool: this simply makes your character invisible to other players, you can also use your weapons while in invisible and still do damage, but this tends to be a bit glitchy and may fling you if you walk upto objects while invisible.


Toggle AFK: this simply allows you to make it look like your afk by displaying the afk message above your player.
